What did push me to finally write a blog? Well, the final kick came after watching Ash Furrow's excellent talk: [Teaching and Learning](https://youtu.be/SjjvnrqDjpM?list=PLdr22uU_wISpW6XI1J0S7Lp-X8Km-HaQW) from this years UIKonf. 

During the talk Ash makes many well reasoned points on the virtues of both writing a blog and open sourcing your company's code. Not all of it, you're not going to give away a full package that you financially rely on. But is it possible that by open sourcing some of the common modules or blogging about how you develop, you'll not only gain visibility for you and your company, but help yourself and others at the same time. 

So, let's see. 

I highly recommend the [videos](http://www.uikonf.com/videos/) at UIKonf, but if you only watch one, make it [this](https://youtu.be/SjjvnrqDjpM?list=PLdr22uU_wISpW6XI1J0S7Lp-X8Km-HaQW) one.
